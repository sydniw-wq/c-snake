This is a console based implementation that allows us to play the game in a console. In order to produce a fully functional implementation we have to ensure
we complete the following items.

Snake implementation logic:
- need to store the coordinates of the snakes body (two arrays, 1 for x corrdinates and 1 for y corrdinates)
- move the had of the snake according to user input, body follows the head (W = up, A = left, S = down, D = right)
- when the snake eats fruit the length of the body increases (coordinate arrays updated)
- if snake collides with itself or the wall then game is over

Fruit implementation logic:
- fruit is presented as a single coordinate, randomly placed within the boundary of the game board
- if snake head collides with fruit, the snake length increases and the fruit is removed from the game board

Boundary implementation logic:
- game board is drawn using specific characters, boundaries act as collision zone

Game motion implementation logic:
- game motion generated by an infinite loop that continues to update based on the movement of the snake (checking game events/updates)
- static images continuously created to give the appearance of dynamic motion

Real time response logic:
- use functions provide by console libraries, return pressed character immediately as soon as the key is pressed

Implementating all of these individual pieces of logic through functions will allow use to create small main function to run the game.
